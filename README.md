# Crystal Server (Rust Library)

This is the open-source library for the now on public-beta project [Crystal Server](https://crystal-server.co/).
Crystal Server is a service that allows you to make multiplayer games easily, safely and fast.

While this library may be used in production games, it's still early in development and compability is not just yet guaranteed.
Even so, the library will NOT change how it works: the way you use the library will stay (relatively) the same, so when the library goes out of beta you may still continue using (almost) the same code as you started with.
